NetTime: an app to show the current number of beats on your iOS device and on your Apple Watch!

A beat is the time represented as a decimal.  There are 1,000 in a day, each of which lasts 86.4 seconds.  The time in beats is the same no matter where you are in the world, regardless of whether daylight savings is in effect!

NetTime shows the current number of beats on your iOS device and (optionally) notification centre.  It can also calculate the number of beats at any given time.

If you own an Apple Watch, you can see current number of beats on your wrist.  You can even show the current number of beats on your watch face, and see the time in beats up to 100 beats in the future or past.

All feedback and suggestions are more than welcomed!
