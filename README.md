This is the NetTime Open Source Edition.  NetTime is an app that shows the current time in [Swatch Internet Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time) on your iOS device.

[NetTime is currently available on the Apple App Store.](https://appsto.re/i6Yc3VC)  The difference between the App Store & Open Source versions of the app is the open source version also includes a watchOS component of the app.  Apple refused to allow the watch components I created as their primary functionality was to tell the time, albeit in the esoteric way that Swatch Internet Time is!

More full building instructions will be added shortly.
